# Process Scheduler Demo


This source code functions as a process scheduler, showcasing the burst times of processes through first-come-first-serve, shortest-job-first, and priority scheduling algorithms. The preferred algorithm can be easily switched by modifying the SCHEDULING_ALGORITHM variable within the process.c file.
